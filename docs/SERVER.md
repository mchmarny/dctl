# dctl - server

> Assumes you have already [authenticated](../README.md)

Once the data has been imported, the easiest way to view it is to start a local server: 

```shell
dctl server
```

The result should be the information with the address:

```shell
INFO    server started on 127.0.0.1:8080
```

At this point you can use your browser to navigate to [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) to view the data. 

> You can change the port on which the server starts by providing the `--port` flag.
